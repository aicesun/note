### The velocity records were first corrected for the instrumental response, the mean from the  whole signal removed and differentiated to acceleration.

### Then, time windows starting 0.5s  before the S-wave onset and ending when 90 percent of the total energy after the S-wave onset has been released, with a minimum and maximum allowed duration of 5 and 15 s, respectively, have been extracted and tapered with a 5% Hanning-window.
### For the selected  windows, the acceleration FAS have been calculated and smoothed using the Konno and  Ohmachi (1998) algorithm, fixing the smoothing parameter b to 40.

### The spectral amplitudes are analyzed at 36 frequencies, equally spaced on a logarithmic scale over the range 0.5â€“30 Hz.
### Pre-event noise windows of equal length as the signal windows were used to compute the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and, at each frequency point, only records with a SNR  larger than 3 were retained.
### Figure 3 shows examples of SNR calculated for three stations  located in different positions over the study area and equipped with different instrumentation systems.
### AQ06 and GFZ05 are velocimetric stations whereas MI01 is accelerometric.
### Moreover MI01 and GFZ05 are installed on outcropping rock while AQ06 is located on the alluvial deposits of the Aterno river (see Fig. 1 and Bergamaschi et al. this issue).
### The SNR are high with median values between 10 and 1,000 and only few frequency points with a ratio smaller than 3. For the whole data set, the number of selected spectral amplitudes, based on SNR > 3, spans from 1,124 at 0.5 Hz to 1,161 at 10 Hz.
